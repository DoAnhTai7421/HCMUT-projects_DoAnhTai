PLC PROGRAMMING FOR AUTOMATED PACKAGING SYSTEM CONTROL
- This project is part of the PLC Programming course. It involves designing wiring diagrams for input/output devices, describing algorithms using SFC and STL diagrams, and programming the PLC to read sensor values and control the actuation mechanisms of the automated packaging system. In addition, GT Designer 3 software was used to design the HMI interface for the control buttons.
