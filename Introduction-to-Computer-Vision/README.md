JPEG STANDARD IMAGE COMPRESSION METHOD
This project, developed for the Introduction to Computer Vision course, utilizes the C# programming language and image compression techniques based on the JPEG standard (color processing, Discrete Cosine Transform, quantization, zigzag scanning, Huffman encoding, etc.) to reduce image size (i.e., increase the compression ratio).
